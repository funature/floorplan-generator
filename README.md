floorplan-generator
===================

Plug-in for BIMserver to create a 2D HTML floorplan generator.

DISCLAIMER 

This plugin was developed by Chris Bogen and Nicholas Moore at the Engineer Research Development Center (ERDC), US Army Corps of Engineers.
This software comes with no warranty, gaurantee, and follows the same licensing model defined in the BIMServer project.
ERDC reserves the right to ulimited and free useage of any products that contain extensions, enhancements, or dependencies to this code.

NOW for some technical matters...

This project depends on some of the resources included in the standard COBie plugins page (the COBie shared project).

Also, j3dcore.jar, j3dutils.jar, and vecmath.jar must be in the Bimserver/lib directory.  See Java3d/J3d.

Also, those j3d dependencies need to be setup to point to the native dll (on windows machines). j3dcore-ogl.dll.  We have been putting that dll
in BimServer/native/j3dcore-ogl.dll

We'll get all that straightened out soon and perhaps put all those dependencies in the floorplan lib folder.

There are other details forthcoming...
